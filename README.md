# Project: Simple Budget Tracker

This project will help participants understand all the concepts mentioned by building a simple application to track income and expenses.

## Key Features

### 1. Using Strict Mode

- Ensure all code uses `'use strict'` to avoid common mistakes.

### 2. Adding Income and Expenses

- Users can input the amount of income or expenses (can use example input 1 and example input 2).
- Values must be in numeric format (understanding data types and type conversions).

### 3. Displaying Total Balance

- The system will calculate the total balance based on all income and expenses.
- Use basic math operators for calculations.

### 4. Checking Balance Status

- If the balance < 0, display a warning message.
- If the balance > 0, display a success message.
- If the balance is null/undefined, use the nullish coalescing operator to display a default value.

### 5. Comparing Income vs Expenses

- If expenses are greater than income, display a warning.
- Use comparisons and if-else statements.

### 6. Using Logical Operators

- Check if the user inputs valid data before calculating the balance.
